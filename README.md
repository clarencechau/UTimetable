# UTimetable: The Timetable Comparer For UofT Students 

# Overview
The main purpose of this program is to allow University of Toronto students to compare timetables with their friends in 
order to find mutual free timeslots. This project idea came to mind because as students ourselves, we always found it 
trivial to make plans with large friend groups where everyone has different schedules. This program allows us to find
time to study together, or make a meeting for clubs, etc.
